### From meter to light years in less than a second

## Brief
units is a small crate that ease the **conversion between commonly physics units** such as meters, kg, and so on.
It's currently in development and many unit types are missing (temperature, pressure).
Theses will be added incrementally. Do not hesitate to make a PR if you want to add the kind of unit you need.

### Features
- Atomic units representations (meters, grams, second) in various scales
- Scaling with common prefix (km, kg, Âµs, ...)
- Compound units (km/^s-2, k*gm/s)
- Date representation
- Units conversion
- Prettified display
